## Documentation Synchronization

When updating project documentation, ensure consistency across related documents:

### SCORING_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md Synchronization

- **Ongoing Work**: Changes to `SCORING_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` must be reflected in the corresponding phase document under `/planning/phase-N_<phase-name>.md`
- **Completed Phases**: When marking work as complete, move the relevant content from `SCORING_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md` to `/planning/COMPLETED_PHASES.md` and update the specific phase document accordingly
- Always maintain **bidirectional consistency** – changes in phase documents should be reflected in the main plan
